# How to use the game ?
At first, you need to install the JDK. The latest JDK works fine !

We provide two scripts and a junit.jar dependencie for compilation
- compile to compile the project
- run to run the game

First of all, open a command prompt in the folder containing all packages

To play our game on Linux, you need to open a command prompt in the folder where scripts are and type ./compile && ./run then enter
To play our game on Windows, you can try ./compile && ./run. If it doesn't work, you can try to execute ./run_win. If it fails, then you can try the command java -jar Game.jar

It should run easily ! Our game is playable throught a command line. 
You'll read a story and can influence it by typing commands ! For exemple, type LOOK ITM will show you all items around you. 
You can take them by typing TAKE <name of the item> !
You can find all commands by typing HELP in the command line
